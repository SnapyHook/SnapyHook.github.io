# SnapyHook – Research Notes & Tooling

This repository serves as a collection of my research notes, experiments, and tooling related to **systems programming, reverse engineering, and runtime analysis**.

My work focuses on understanding how large native applications behave internally — particularly around virtual machines, scripting runtimes, and binary execution pipelines.
